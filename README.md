# What makes a recipe highly rated?
Final Project for DSC 80 at UCSD

by Zijie Feng

## Introduction

- My dataset is about food recipes and user ratings of these recipes. The dataset itself has 83782 rows and 13 columns, including ['name', 'id', 'minutes', 'contributor_id', 'submitted', 'tags', 'nutrition', 'n_steps', 'steps', 'description', 'ingredients', 'n_ingredients', 'average_rating_recipe']

- The main question I will try to answer is: what types of recipes tend to have a higher average rating? To answer this question, relevant columns would include 'minutes', 'submitted', 'tags', 'nutrition', 'n_steps', 'ingredients', 'n_ingredients', 'average_rating_recipe'. However, since 'ingredients' and 'tags' have too many unique values in them and would make this study much more complicated, I decided to not include these 2.

- 'minutes' contains the number of minutes needed to complete a recipe; 'submitted' has the date when the recipe was submitted; 'nutrition' has the amount of different nutritions a recipe contains; 'n_steps' contains the number of steps to complete a recipe; 'n_ingredients' has the number of ingredients for a recipe; 'average_rating_recipe' has the average rating for a certain recipe across users.

- With these pieces of information, I should be able to get some insight regarding the characteristics that impact the ratings. With such insights, users are able to have a more objective evaluation of a recipe. When checking other people's ratings on a certain recipe, now we can first use the insights gained from this project to determine a reasonable rating and then compare it with other users' ratings.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning

- I merged the recipes and interactions datasets together to pair the user ratings with the recipes themselves. In the merged dataset, I changed ratings of 0 to np.NaN values since these 0's don't actually mean a rating of 0. Instead, they simply mean a rating was not placed. It was only with this change, would the calculation of the mean ratings for each recipe make sense. Then, I attached the column of calculated average ratings for each recipe to the right of the original recipes dataset, with a left merge.

- Another critical step was that I converted the column of 'nutrition' into several columns each representing the amount of a certain element contained by the recipes. The original 'nutrition' column contains strings that are formatted like lists. So I first converted them into real lists, and then converted this series of lists into an array of arrays, which was converted to a dataframe, that is merged back to the recipes dataset. Also, the original 'nutrition' column was dropped.

- Another small fix was the conversion of the 'submitted' column into pd.datetime format.

- There are 3 columns with missing values and one of them is really important, which is the 'average_rating_recipe' column. So, I used probabilistic imputation to fill in the missing values by drawing from other existing values in the column.

- At this point, all the features I am concerned with should be converted to formats that are easy to work with, without any missing values.
